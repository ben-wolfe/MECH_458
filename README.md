# UVic MECH 458 - Mechatronics

## Project Description
In this project, we interfaced several sensors, a DC motor, and a stepper 
motor to an Atmel AT90USB1287 microcontroller and programed its operation in C. The system 
collected data using two optical sensors, a reflective sensor, an inductive sensor, and a Hall 
effect sensor.  The conveyor succesfully sorted a total of 48 blocks (a random order of steel, 
white, aluminum and black) in 28 seconds.
