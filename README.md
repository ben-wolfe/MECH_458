# UVic MECH 458 - Mechatronics

## Course Description
Introduction to mechatronic systems; modelling of mixed mechatronic systems; 
microcontroller programming and interfacing; data acquisition; sensors and actuators; 
control architectures and case studies in mechatronics systems.

## Project Description
In this project, we were required to interface several sensors, a DC motor, and a stepper 
motor to an Atmel AT90USB1287 microcontroller and program its operation in C. The system 
collects data and responds to its environment using two optical sensors, a reflective sensor, 
an inductive sensor, and a Hall effect sensor.  The conveyor succesfully sorted a total of 
48 blocks (a random order of steel, white, aluminum and block) in 28 seconds).
